Dept reasoning for alternate mtg pattern:
The course is required of all the department's master's degree students, some of whom are always doing student-teaching off campus and therefore 
unavailable before 4PM.  To accomodate their shcedules the course can only meet once per week (for 21/2 hours), and it would be unreasonable to 
require the course to begin later, thus ending past PM for students who have already put in a full day of teaching.  The Classics department's 
graduate level courses have always (30+ years) been taught in this time slot.

This class offers an introduction to the short story as a literary genre. It will cover a wide variety of texts, particularly -- but not exclusively -- from 
the Anglo and Latin American traditions from the 19th century until the present. All works will be read in translation. The main objective of the class 
is to teach students the analytical tools how to read, interpret, and discuss short stories. Further, it aims at improving critical writing skills and your 
awareness of the world. We will explore the cultural context and the power relations operative within each individual story, especially with 
reference to race, class, and gender.

Honors Thesis Seminar: 1st Sem
Course Title - Society and Environment: Global and Local Perspectives 

Course Description: This two-semester Capstone Course offers a multidisciplinary exploration of interactions between people and environment, and 
the social and political institutions affecting these interactions. In addition to the question of how scarce resources are allocated among competing 
ends (for example, a cleaner environment versus more consumer goods), the course explores how natural resources and access to a clean 
environment are allocated among competing people and communities.  Students will be helped to develop capstone thesis projects related to society 
and environment in diverse fields.  

Preference given to Commonwealth Honors College Juniors and Seniors using this course towards their Capstone Experience requirement.

General Education course taught entirely in English, and all films have English subtitles.  This semester's focus is on contemporary French and 
Francophone films.  Using the background you acquire from the assigned readings, papers, lectures, screenings, and meetings of your discussion 
section, you will learn how to do a critical film analysis.  We will explore recent debates about French identity in light of the challenges posed by 
immigration (especially non-European immigration), feminism, economic and cultural globalization, and France's version of ?multiculturalism," 
casting a wide net over cinema to examine the privileged relationship between a nation, an art, and a social practice.

This course is open to Political Science majors only.
Non Majors need Instructor consent
There is little consensus within political science about how to study politics. Political scientists use a range of approaches, and hold a variety of 
methodological commitments. This course is designed to introduce students to the philosophical and epistemological disputes that have given rise to 
this lack of consensus. The aim of the course is to enable students to make more deeply informed judgments about the types of political science work 
that they encounter and undertake. Students will be encouraged to appreciate alternative approaches to political analysis, weigh their relative utility 
in answering questions of importance to them, and determine whether and how these different approaches might fruitfully be combined.

DESCRIPTION: HONORS GEN ED (AT): The Performance of Identity. This class intertwines basic communication theory with study and 
performance of archetypical characters in Western Dramatic Literature (such as Henry IV, The Fool, Hedda Gabler, The Founding Father, Buffy). 
By viewing and performing these timeless characters through the lens of interpersonal and intrapersonal communication theories, the student 
experiences first hand (and in a larger-than-life context) how to motivate large groups, how to create collaboration out of chaos, how to be just, how 
to connect viscerally with peers, strangers and intimate friends without the safety net of technological mediation.
